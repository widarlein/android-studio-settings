  You appear to have CocoaPods installed but it is not working.
  This can happen if the version of Ruby that CocoaPods was installed with is different from the one being used to invoke it.
  This can usually be fixed by re-installing CocoaPods.
For re-installation instructions, see https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation
